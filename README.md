# Flappity-New-Roguelike

Taking what I learned in the python + libtcod tutorial and starting from scratch so I can build things differently,
so I can make things work how I want them to.

Other interesting files (if I get around to updating/creating them) will include todo.txt and feature_ideas.txt
