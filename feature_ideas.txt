IDEAS!

Map Generation is (obviously) a pretty huge thing.  I have so many options for map generation.

First Idea: Large modular rooms/complexes connected by hallways (or caves or whatever). Complexes being anywhere from 30x30 to 50x50 (or maybe bigger) and being a sub-routine within the procedural generation. In a castle, it might generate a servants' quarters, and a dining hall + kitchens, and then a barracks/armory, and so on. Each module would be themed, and all the modules in a dungeon would fit under the same theme (though one module might end up in more than one theme).  Creating a lot of variety would be a lot of work, because I wouldn't want the same 6 modules over and over throughout a dungeon.

Similarly, I could go rooms that are a more typical roguelike size, but still themed. A dining room, a bedroom, a sleeping quarters, and so on. It'd be easier to come up with a larger number of rooms (as opposed to complexes above), since I could have kitchen, dining room, mess hall, etc etc all as separate rooms.  A downside to this is you might run into rooms that are oddly placed. Ideally the rooms would be generated based on their neighbor. "This room is a kitchen. Usually these are near dining rooms and mess halls." Each room would be able to generate any type of room next to it, but it would be weighted towards similar rooms. This would mean you would be likely to end up with clusters of military rooms, clusters of food rooms, royalty/nobility-related rooms, etc.  It'd still play into the themed dungeon idea, but it might feel more similar to a nethack-style dungeon.
